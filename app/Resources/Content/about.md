## Hello
My name is Dennis Skoko and I'm a student at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se/eng/)
and studying Web Programming. I like to spent time on my personal projects like frameworks and modules
that aids me and maybe someone else on their projects.
You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/DennisSkoko) where I keep some of my projects.

My main programming language is PHP but I am not afraid to play around with other languages.
The following languages I know is:
* PHP
* MySQL
* HTML/CSS
* Less
* C++
* Java

While these are languages I know a little but still learning:
* Python
* JavaScript/jQuery
