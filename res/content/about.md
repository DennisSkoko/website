## About
I live in Karlskrona, Sweden and I'm a student at [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se/eng/)
where I study web programming.
I like to spend time doing some personal projects, or doing some projects for people that I know.
Other than that I usually hangout with friends.

I mostly focus on back-end with PHP but since I usually do these projects alone, I do front-end as well.
I've played with most of the programming languages but PHP is the one I know inside-out. I've also played with Node.js.
For front-end I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and LESS.

For other projects other than web applications I also know C++ and Java.
