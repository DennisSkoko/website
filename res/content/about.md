## About

I live in Karlskrona, Sweden and I'm a student at the university of [Blekinge Institute of Technology](https://www.bth.se/eng/)
where I study web programming. I like to spend time doing some personal projects,
or doing some projects for people that I know. Other than that I usually hangout with friends.

I moslty focus on back-end with PHP and Node.js but since I usually do these projects alone,
I'm a little experienced with CSS, LESS and jQuery.

I also know C++ from some courses at my university and have been doing projects in Java as well.
