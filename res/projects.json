    "description": "My sister started her own company and asked me to do a very simple website that can be used to reach out to the customers. Since she bought the cheapest webserver, I had to use PHP. She also wanted to be able to edit the content herself whenever she wanted to so I created an admin page where she could login and edit the content. The content is stored on a MySQL server.",

When I worked at Ericsson I created a similar project but with Anuglar but I didn't want to show the source code of that project, so I instead created a similar one but with Vue. The data is only random generated and doesn't actually test a database.",
