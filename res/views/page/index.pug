                    h2 About
                    p.
                        I live in Karlskrona, Sweden and I'm a student at
                        #[a(href='https://www.bth.se/eng/') Blekinge Institute of Technology]
                        where I study web programming. I like to spend time doing
                        some personal projects, or doing some projects for people that I know.
                        Other than that I usually hangout with friends.
                    p.
                        I mostly focus on back-end with PHP but since I usually do these
                        projects alone, I do front-end as well. I've played with most of
                        the programming languages but PHP is the one I know inside-out.
                        I've also played with Node.js. For front-end I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and LESS.
                    p.
                        For other projects other than web applications I also know C++ and Java.
